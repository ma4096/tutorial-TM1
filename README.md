# tutorial-TM1
Notes from my tutorials on technical mechanics 1 @TUHH in the winter term 24/25

Notes will be added as tutorials are hold, they are sorted by group.
I take notes with https://canvas.apps.chrome/ and upload the images here.

If you need more training material, I can really recommend the free online course by Johanna Peters on Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU): https://learn.hoou.de/course/view.php?id=489

Tutorial 32 is held on Tuesdays and tutorial 10 on Mondays, times and rooms can be found on studip.
